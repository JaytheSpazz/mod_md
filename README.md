# mod_md - Everybody Spies

Copyright 2017 greenbytes GmbH

This repository contains `mod_md`, a module for Apache httpd that adds support for Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs). 

This code here is to help people review and comment and test early versions. Issues you can raise here, general discussion is probably best at the httpd dev mailing list.

## Documentation

Look [on the wiki](https://github.com/icing/mod_md/wiki) for directions on how to use ```mod_md```.

## Status

The plan is to backport the module and all the necessary patches into the next 2.4.x release of Apache httpd. That
will be at least revision 2.4.30. And I will push for it to come out this year. Time will tell.

For the impatient and danger seekers: what you find here is a copy of what lives inside the Apache httpd ```trunk``` repository. While people find an occasional
hickup - mostly due to some unique aspect in the setups - several people, including myself, are running this inside a patched
2.4 Apache for months now. And successfully.  

However, this is not _checkout, configure and shoot_. For it to work, you need a patched mod_ssl (patch is provided in directory ```patches```), but that is about the only complication.

 There is an ever expanding test suite included against a local [boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder) server, using the excellent [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). Also, thanks to Jacob Champion, we have unit tests available when [check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/) is installed.

The Apache2 PPA for ubuntu by @oerdnj, see [here](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2/+packages), has a patched ```mod_ssl``` just as ```mod_md``` needs it! Thanks! So, in such a server you just need to drop mod_md from here.

### Test Status

Tests have been verified to run on MacOS and Ubuntu 16.04 under the following conditions:

 * the *SSL library you compile with supports ```SNI``` 
 * curl is linked against this recent *SSL lib
 * your Apache httpd installation has a patched ```mod_ssl```
 * you have a local boulder server installed and it resolved host names against your httpd (see below)

So, it's a bit tricky when your OS does not support features like ```SNI``` in its standard config.

## Install

See [2.4.x Installation](https://github.com/icing/mod_md/wiki/2.4.x-Installation) on the wiki.

See ```ChangeLog``` for details.

## Licensing

This work is supported by an Award from MOSS, the Mozilla Open Source Support project. Many thanks to these excellent people! You are awesome!

Test cases mostly written by my colleague @michael-koeller who made this to a good part really a test driven development. Thanks!
