                <h1>All the Things Promised [to MOSS]</h1>
                <p>
                    With the release of version <a href="https://github.com/icing/mod_md/releases/tag/v2.2.2">v2.2.2</a>
                    the project sponsored by MOSS, Mozilla's Open Source Support, has 
                    been concluded.  
                    You will soon see the result appear in various releases, such as Fedora and
                    Debian unstable. What can you expect? How does this benefit you?
                    Three things: Real ACME, Safer Stapling and Easy Monitoring. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="center">
                <h3>Real ACME</h3>
                <p>
                The ACME standard, which Let's Encrypt (LE) uses (and initiated), is replacing 
                its proprietary predecessor. There is no gently nudging, LE has started to 
                shut down new accounts on its old API. In the next year, you can expect this 
                API to fade away.
                </p><p>
                Then you'll need at least Apache 2.4.41 to use its built-in ACME support
                (via the included mod_md module, v2.0.x). Besides the Apache releases, you
                will always find more frequent ones in 
                <a href="https://github.com/icing/mod_md">the module's github</a> and
                some distributions, such as Fedora, are already integrating those.
                </p><p>
                The ACME standard support should be much more stable and hopefully long-term.
                Other CAs are picking it up as well. But as with everything related to security
                on the internet, development will not stop.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="center">
                <h3>Safer Stapling (OCSP)</h3>
                <p>
                If you use https: certificates in your server (and according to Firefox 
                telemetries, that are more than 80% of the requests today), your server needs
                to provide Stapling information to clients. 
                </p><p>
                Or at least should. While it is not totally mandatory, it is also good
                for performance of your site. Which means a lot of people copy and pasted
                some stackoverflow Apache configuration and that did the job.
                </p><p>
                This configuration continues to work in the new Apache releases. But it will,
                in its next release offer new one.
                </p><p>
                This new implementation, developed in the MOSS project, is designed to make
                your server much more resilient against outages of your certificate
                provider. 
                </p><p>
                It persists the Stapling information and makes it instantly available again
                after a server restart. And it refreshes it a day or two before its expiration.
                Outages would have to last longer than this to affect you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="center">
                <h3>Easy Monitoring</h3>
                <p>
                Apache with the new mod_md offers you new ways to supervise your certificate
                and stapling: HTML page, JSON views and notifications.
                </p>
                <img src="mod_md_status.png" width="100%"/>
                <p>
                Apache's "server-status" page now gives you sections about certificates and
                stapling as well. Two tables where all the things managed by mod_md can be
                seen at a glance. You'll know what is valid, when renewals are planned and 
                observe the status of ongoing activities.
                </p>
                <img src="mod_md_ocsp_status.png" width="100%"/>
                <p>
                If you want to write own scripts to evaluate this, there is now a JSON view
                with all details. This should make it ease to integrate information into any
                control panel for your server/network.
                </p><p>
                In addition, the module will run a configurable command of yours on certain
                events: a certificate was renewed, stapling was refreshed, an error was
                encountered, etc. See MDMessageCmd for details.
                </p><p>
                If you have only a few domains to manage, you may do as myself and let Apache
                send you a mail about it. If you have a larger host/network, you probably
                already have a monitoring framework which you may want to feed these 
                notifications to.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                I am very grateful to the people at MOSS for sponsoring this project. They are
                a pleasure to work with. Should you have an idea on how to improve
                internet security or accessibility, do not hesitate to ask them for support!
                </p><p>
                Cheers,
                </p>
