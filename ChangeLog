v1.1.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some attempts at code readability, increased logging level for fallback cert generation that
   was swept under the DEBUG carpet before.
 * More verbosity when *not* handing out certificates, e.g. mod_ssl asks, but mod_md has no
   idea what it is talking about. Some people report misbehaviour here.
 * Re-enabled support for md_get_credentials() function that was used in older mod_ssl
   patch, so that people with old patched servers get a chance to upgrade.
 
v1.1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When ACME fails to authenticate your domain, the exact server answer is logged
   as error. This helps to find out the reason for the failed challenge, for example
   when ACME reports a 'Timeout' if it could not reach your server. Implements #70.

v1.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed wrong mem pool use for auto-added server names.
 
v1.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The first configuration check was skipping parts that are needed, especially for new
   MDs, and crash if mod_ssl calls back "too early". Reverting that change.

v1.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed backward compaitbility to '<ManagedDomain' configurations, used in pre v1.1.0 versions
   to continue working. Test case added.
 * added httpd version checks to test cases that make use of 2.5.0 mod_ssl features. Tests now
   run clean against a 2.4.30 installation.

v1.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPORTANT: name change in configuration directives. The Apache team decided that the current
   names would confuse you, the users, and asked for a change. The old names are still working
   in this version, so you can safely upgrade. 
   They will give warnings in the log and will disappear in the immediate future.
   * ManagedDomain is now MDomain
   * <ManagedDomain> is now <MDomainSet>
 
v1.0.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * removed old EXPERIMENTAL code for defaulting to Lets Encrypt staging area.
 * acme now follows "up" link headers to retrieve issuer certificate chain. This
   will lead to shorter chains as the "up" links will stop at the cert that browsers
   trust instead of always going to the topmost root. 
   See https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/3259
 * Fixed a missing argument in a debug log statement.

v1.0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fix in configure: checking for the correct arc4random_buf now.

v1.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * restricting post_config dry run to be more silent and performing
   only necessary work for mod_ssl to be also happy with the configuration.

v1.0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed various bugs in persisting job properties, so that status is persisted across
   child process changes and staging is reset on reloads.
 * changed MDCertificateAgreement url checks. As long as the CA reports that the account
   has an agreement, no further checking is done. Existing accounts need no changes when
   a new agreement comes out. This is as Let's Encrypt rolls.

v1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * staging reset on reload also triggered when MDCertificateAgreement was initially missing.

v1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer auto-added to a Managed Domain.
   Fixes issue #57.
 * Error counts of jobs are presisted now. When the server restarts (gracefully) any errored
   staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal process. Fixes issue #55

v1.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive 'MDNotifyCmd' that will run when Managed Domains have been signed up/renewed. The
   names of the MDs is given as arguments to the command.

v0.9.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Protocol driving now *applies* correct server properties for http/https challenge selection, 
   with new test cases (fixes issue #52).

v0.9.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Protocol driving now uses correct server properties for http/https challenge selection 
   (refs issue #52).

v0.9.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When building against 2.4.x, one probably needs to configure without ```--enable-werror```,
   since there were some warnings fixed in Apache httpd trunk.
 * Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. Module now requires at least mod_ssl
   patch v4 in place.
 * Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
 * ```MDRequireHttps``` now happens before any ```Redirect```.
 * added some compiler warning flags and adding casts/eliminating some unused params accordingly

v0.9.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * For Managed Domains with 'MDRequireHttps permanent' a HSTS (rfc6797) header is added
   in the response with value 'max-age=15768000', if not already there.

v0.9.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
   new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
 * Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
   after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
   to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messages might appear a
   second time in the logs.
 * --with-openssl configure option provided by [caminada](https://github.com/caminada) to
   specify an uncommon location of the lib.
 * --with-jansson configure option provided by [caminada](https://github.com/caminada) to
   specify an uncommon location of the lib.
 * Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
   is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
   VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
   its address list.

v0.9.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
   or temporarily.
 * Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
   a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.

v0.9.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some sanity checks for MDHttpProxy parameter.
 * Rewrote logic to re-schedule MD jobs and announce renewal completion and server restarts. Related
   to issue #42
 * Additional tweaks for libressl support, thanks to @Sp1l 
 * Implemented alternative for OpenSSL ASN1_TIME_diff() helper which is not available in
   libressl. 

v0.9.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixes for conversions in gcc, fixed duration parsing when apr_strtoi64() defaults to 0 on
   not seeing any digit.
 * New config directive 'MDHttpProxy <url>' to specify a HTTP(S) proxy for outgoing connections.
   Supported in a2md with the '--proxy <url>' command line option.
 * Synched mod_ssl patch with Apache subversion again and made v4 of the patch. Only changes
   were in log messages, so no need to repatch existing installations.

v0.9.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
   someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
   reload and change back to the wanted ones.
 * various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
 * mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
   to facilitate upgrades.

v0.9.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Improved interface to mod_ssl for fallback handling. Backward compatible to previous mod_ssl
   patch, but fallbacks will not work.
 * Provide a temporary, self-signed certificate with a speaking command and domain name if we
   have no other cert for a Managed Domain, yet. Refs github issue #32
 * Continue to provide expired or not-completely matching, existing certificate for a Managed
   Domain until the renewal was successful. This is helpful when one adds a DNS name to
   a MD, so the previous domains can be served while a new cert is requested.

v0.8.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All files necessary to run tests are not in the release package.
 * Making "http-01" the preferred challenge type again, as people "tls-sni-01" requires at least
   one working certificate vhost right now - which not everyone has.
 * moved part of the MD sanity checks from post_config to check_config phase, allowing for error
   detection in check-only runs.

v0.8.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive ```MDPrivateKeys``` to specify the type and parameter to private key generation.
   Currently only 'RSA' is supported as type with an option number of bits >= 2048 as parameter.
   Simple test cases for config handling added.
 * Private RSA keys are now generated with 2048 bits by default. Use ```MDPrivateKeys``` for
   higher security. 
 
v0.8.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPORTANT: store format change. The following changes will be made to an existing md store on 
   first start with a new version (be it by mod_md in the server or a run by a new 'a2md'):
      * pkey.pem will be renamed to privkey.pem
      * cert.pem and chain.pem will be concatenated to pubcert.pem. The former files will remain,
        but no longer be used. They will disappear on next renewal.
   ADVICE: If the current store data is vital to you, please make a backup first!

v0.7.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed test case clearing of store to keep key alive, enabling true random store key again.
 * Removed pun "Something, like certbot" from the User-Agent request header. Refs issue #34
 * Cleaned up reporting of missing/mismatched MDCertificateAgreement in the logs. This will
   no longer trigger early retries.
 * badNonce encounters are no longer reported as errors. Retries are attempted now silently.
   Refs issue #35
 * new default MDRenewWindow. Instead of 14 days, the default is now a third before the end of
   the certificates lifetime. For the usual 90 days of Let's Encrypt certificates, this makes
   an effective renewal window of 30 days - as recommended by LE. Refs issue #30
 * Enabled conversion warnings if supported by compiler, eliminated several signed/unsigned
   warnings.

v0.7.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LIVE: the real Let's Encrypt CA is now live by default! If you need to experiment, configure
``` 
    MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```    
 * When existing, complete certificates are renewed, the activation of the new ones is
   delayed by 24 hours (or until the existing ones expire, whatever is earlier) to accommodate
   for clients with weird clocks, refs #1. 
 * Fixed store sync when MDCAChallenges was removed again from an MD. 
 * Fixed crash when MD matched the base server, fixes #23
 * Fixed watchgod resetting staging when server processes disappeared (e.g. reached
   max requests or other limits).

v0.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * global or inside ManagedDomain, 'MDMembers auto|manual' defines if ServerName and ServerAlias
   names of a VirtualHost are automatically added to the members of a Managed Domain or not.
   Default is 'auto'.
 * staging information, e.g. temp files during ACME protocol runs, gets automatically reset
   when the managed domain changes.
 * when synching new configurations into the store, the list of domain names is now kept
   exactly the same. This allows removal of a member that fails challenges. Before, only
   additions have been stored. Test cases adjusted.
 * Fixed 'uninitialized var use' when logging too new store version, reported in #25

v0.6.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Restructuring of the source tree to something very similar as it will appear in the 
   Apache subversion repository. Will make synching of changes easier.
 * Test of special handling of store archive handling for Windows system. See issue #24.

v0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Documentation on wiki for several use cases, explaining file store layout and security
 * User-Agent now sent to CA.
   Driving from httpd: Apache/rev mod_md/rev (Something, like certbot)
   Driving from a2md:  apachemd/rev mod_md/rev (Something, like certbot)
 * Logging adjusted for more readable INFO level on relevant changes
 * NOTICE level log when new certificate have been obtained and restart is recommended
 * removed code for service restart, should now compile under Win32
 
v0.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Various test runs on live server with ACME staging and real service. First green lock
   obtained by mod_md!
 * Various fixes to permission issues on ubuntu setup server (root/www-data users)
 * Fixed defaults for port mapping
 * New 'MDDriveMode always' to acquire certificates for Managed Domains not used in any
   VirtualHost on the server. Fixed test cases for auto drive mode. Refactored some copy+paste
   code in tests.
 * Test cases stop the httpd server less, making better timings and reliability 
 * adding test and fixes for new config directive 'MDCAChallenges' when no configured challenge
   type is supported by the ACME server.

v0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Adding test case coverage for own base64url coder.
 * ACME challenge type "tls-sni-01" supported. Needs new mod_ssl patch 
   (patches/mod_ssl_md-trunk-v2.diff).
 * Merged check based unit test infrastructure by the awesome 
   [Jacob Champion](https://github.com/jchampio) and linked them to standard 'make test'
 * Using ${prefix}/bin/curl if available. Fixed test cases that failed when curl has SNI
   support.
 * added test that resources are served with "503 Service Unavailable" while TLS credentials
   are still incomplete.
 * disabled a pkey encryption check since it did not work as is un *NIX, fixed gcc warning
 * refcount in md_json_seta adjusted, conversion function expected to always auto-give-away
   their references. 
 * fixed refcount bug in md_json_seta() (supposedly, be optimistic for once!)
 * tls-sni-01 challenge cert and key generated, needs to be activated in mod_ssl

v0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directive 'MDPortMap nn:mm' to announce on which local port an ACME CA might reach
   the server. This is necessary if you have redirected port 80 and/or 443 on your firefall
   to another port on the server that runs mod_md. Example:
   MDPortMap 80:5002   443:5001
   is a mapping needed for testing with a local boulder instance. If your server uses 80+443
   your need not mess with this.
 * Fixed reporting error when os does not support *nix permission bits in file system
 * MDRenewWindow parsing fixed and setting/update in store added, testcases
 * Challenge data is being removed from store when staging is done
 * configure option '--with-boulder=<url>' to specify the URL of the boulder test host (defaults
   to localhost:4000)
 * Changed default ACME CA url to letsencrypt.org staging environment when in MD_EXPERIMENTAL
   mode, adapted test outcomes to this setting
 * a2md drive command now with same checks on renewal as mod_md. New option --force to
   force a renewal that look unnecessary.
 * renew window taken into account when scheduling md watchdog
 * new directive MDRenewWindow which specifies the number of days (per default) that certificates
   should be renewed before they expire. Can be set globally or directly on a MD.
 * when run as normal user, mod_md can restart httpd after successful staging of new credentials
 * protocol driving split into staging and loading phase. a2md does both, httpd watchdog runs
   staging and on restart the staged changes are loaded.
 * security: store generates on init a master pass phrase. All private keys outside of the "domains"
   storage group are only stored encrypted.
 * filesystem store now with relaxed permissions on challenges

v0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directive "MDDriveMode auto|manual". In "auto" mode (more precisely, if auto mode is enabled
   for any managed domain), mod_md will require mod_watchdog to be present and regularly check
   those domains and attempt to retrieve credentials if some are missing
 * drive mode "auto" lacks still various features, function- and security-wise. tbd.

v0.0.2 - v0.0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * various development steps not recorded here
 
v0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new command 'acme validate' to check that account is still known to server and key works
 * fixed all current test failures
 * DNS names are checked for valid characters and non-TLD
 * urls are checked to be absolute for the CA
 * 'make test' now has dependency on all sources being built
 * test cases now use the binary in ./src/a2md instead of the installed one
